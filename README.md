# Muffin-vs-Cupcake-Classification-Using-SVM
Muffin vs Cupcake Classification Using SVM - A fun and educational machine learning project that classifies baked goods as either muffins or cupcakes based on their ingredient proportions using Support Vector Machines (SVM).

### Project Overview:
This project uses Supervised Learning (SVM with a linear kernel) to determine the boundary that best separates muffins and cupcakes based on the quantity of flour and sugar used. It also visually plots the decision boundary and support vectors for better interpretability.

### Tech Stack:
- Python

- Scikit-learn

- NumPy & Pandas

- Matplotlib & Seaborn
